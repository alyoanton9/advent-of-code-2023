# Advent of Code 2023 ⭐️

This repository contains my solutions for the [**Advent of Code 2023**](https://adventofcode.com/2023), in particular the first 9 days.

Maybe next year I'll keep going longer 😅

## How to run

Run the code with `go`:
```shell
go run ./cmd
```

Enter the day and the number of the task:
```shell
Enter the day number (from 1 to 9)
1
Enter task number (1 or 2)
1
```

Check the output in the corresponding file:
```text
./assets/day_1/output_1.txt
```
